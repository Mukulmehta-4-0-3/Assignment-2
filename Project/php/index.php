      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        As transportation plays a vital role in ensuring accessibility to
        educational institutions, we propose the development of a comprehensive
        web application aimed at providing users with a seamless experience in
        navigating bus routes to Northrun College from various key locations.
        This project aims to simplify the process of commuting for students,
        faculty, and visitors alike, enhancing their overall convenience and
        accessibility.
      </p>
      <h3>Project Overview:-</h3>
      <p>
        The proposed web application, <strong> Bus Route Guide </strong> will offer users an
        intuitive platform to plan their journeys efficiently. The application
        will feature detailed information on bus routes, schedules, and stops
        for four primary locations: Brampton, Toronto, Mississauga, and Malton,
        all leading to Northrun College. From this web application, you can
        directly access college's website and other social media links. The
        layout of this web application will follow the same pattern as college's
        website to ensure a smooth and convenient user experience.
